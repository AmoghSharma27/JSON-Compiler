# **Parser for JSON**
**By:** Amogh Sharma

**To run the code**

Simply type the name of the input txt file into line 186 of the code in the first parameter of the "open" functions.
For files with semantic errors, the parser does not print the parse tree for the input and instead prints the semantic errors in the file.

**Assumptions Made**

The code assumes that the input contains only valid JSON tokens and is syntactically correct
